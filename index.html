                <h3>üëãüèº Hey! I'm Miguel Arvelo, a software developer and designer.</h3>
                <p>My focus area is front-end development. I am well-versed in HTML, JavaScript, CSS, and Reactjs. I am a junior web developer who is passionate about developing and learning as much as I can. I enjoy what I do as well as putting my skills to the test, troubleshooting problems, and coming up with solutions. </p>
                <p>I currently reside in Altamonte Springs, Florida. I attend college (part time as to maintain a full time job), working on my bachelors in computer science.</p>

            <div id="Work" class="tabcontent">
                <h3>Work & Experience</h3>
                <p>I have been coding and learning for almost two years. After my first year of learning I landed an internship with <a href="https://www.cubic.com/">Cubic Global Defense</a> as a web developer. Here I would come to see my desire and passion to learn and constantly improve as much as I could. The internship was suppose to last 3 months but due to excellent work ethic and improvement in skill I have extended it twice, now reaching my 9th month. I am also a part time student in Seminole State College so I have completed a handful of computer development classes including JavaScript, HTML, CSS, java, and more.</p>
