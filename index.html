            <h3>üëãüèº Hey! I'm Michael Arvelo, a Front-End Web Developer.</h3>
            <p>My area of focus has been primarily front-end engineering, but I'm interested in growing in all aspects of development. I am well-versed in HTML, JavaScript, CSS, and React. I am passionate and enjoy putting my skills to the test, troubleshooting problems, coming up with solutions, and learning as much as I can. I currently reside in Altamonte Springs, Florida. </p>

            <h3>Work & Experience</h3>
            <p>I have been coding and learning for over two years. After a year of improving my knowledge and skill I landed an internship with <a href="https://www.cubic.com/">Cubic Global Defense</a> as a web developer. While at Cubic I would come to see my passion to learn, as well as desire to continually improve grow. The internship, intended to last three months, was extended many times due to excellent work ethic and improvement in skill. As a result I have been working for Cubic over a year.</p>
            <p>I am also currently enrolled at Seminole State College, where I have covered a variety of courses. Including but not limited to classes with a focus on Javascript, HTML, CSS, Java, and more.</p>
